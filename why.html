    <h1>Why It's Impossible</h1>
    <p>
        Aimbot can be done in so many ways it would be impossible for the budget that Paladins has to update the anticheat.
        And it’s not updating it once because cheat devs will make a new aimbot, and then you have to update your anticheat again and again.
        That’s how it works in any game.

        The only thing I would recommend Paladins doing is fixing the speedhack because it would be possible to remove, I think.
        For anyone thinking you can actually just make yourself run at 10000x speed: no, you teleport with speedhacks really fast—you don’t actually move.

        And you guys go blah blah blah I reported him. Shat up, he’s not getting banned, bad game omg.
        Everyone reading this with an IQ above 20 knows that you’re not actually taking your time to make a Hi-Rez ticket. 
        It does actually get them banned, btw.
